A lawyer's concurrent representation of two or more clients\\r\\nin the same matter raises the possibility or potential for conflicts of interest, as defined in Rule 3-310 of\\r\\nthe California Rules of Professional Conduct. to arise.\\r\\nWe will agree to represent all of your interests in this matter provided that you consent to joint\\r\\nrepresentation notwithst(adingthe potential for conflicts of interest. In addition, we will agree to\\r\\nrepresent you jointly so long as it is understood and agreed that if the firm is ethically required or\\r\\npernitted to withdraw due to a conflict of interest, or is discharged by one of you, the firm may continue\\r\\nto represent the remaining clients) in this and in any other matter, even where be representation may be\\r\\nadverse to one of you and even if confidential information was obtained by the firm during this joint\\r\\nrepresentation that could be adverse to one or more of your interests in another proceeding.\\r\\nAt the present time, we are not aware of facts or circumstances making it reasonably likely that\\r\\nan actual conflict of interest might arise among you in this matter. Likewise, you have not brought to\\r\\nour attention any factual disagreements between you, or other circumstances that you believe might\\r\\nsuggest you have actually divergent interests, disagreements, or conflicts among you with regard to the\\r\\nprosecution of this matter. Nevertheless, that risk is always present. In addition, presently unforeseen\\r\\nconflicts of interest could potentially arise in the future hased on further factual investigation or\\r\\nunanticipated developments.\\r\\nYou should consider the potential conflict of interest issues that can arise from the attorney's\\r\\nduties of loyalty and confidentiality in a joint representarion. The duty of loyalty requires us to act in\\r\\neach of our client's best interests. We cannot give legal advice to one of you that might be detrimental\\r\\nor harmful to another of you, as that would result in divided loyalty. Nor can we represent one of you\\r\\nagainst the other in a disagreement while we jointly represent you. A potential conflict of interest could\\r\\nalso arise if we were called upon to give legal advice to one of you that could have an adverse impact on\\r\\nthe other of you. For example: a difference in recollection of important facts could arise in the future\\r\\nbetween parties; discovery or investigation might reveal that one of you is partially responsible for the\\r\\nalleged harm while the other is not; the amount of money available to satisfy any judgment may be\\r\\ninsufficient to fully compensate each of you, resulting in competing and conflicting claims to the\\r\\navailable funds; disputes may arise over how to allocate any damages award; one client may wish to\\r\\nsettle while the other may not, or we may receive other conflicting instructions regerding how to\\r\\nproceed in the lawsuit. We cannot agree to jointly represent your interests witbout your informed\\r\\nwritten consent and waiver of these potential conflicts.\\r\\nThe duty of confidentiality also requires us to protect your confidential information. Where two\\r\\nor more clients are represented in the same matter, however, all confidential information is shared\\r\\nbetween the joint clients. See California Evidence Code $ 962. This means that if one client has\\r\\nconfidential information that the client does not want to be shared with the other client, then separate\\r\\nlegal counsel should be retained. The risks of sharing confidential information can be reduced or\\r\\ncliminated if each of you retain separate and independent legal counsel. Consequently, if you are not\\r\\ncomfortable accepting the potential risks associated with the sharing of confidential information, you\\r\\nshould consider retzining independent counsel.\\r\\nAdditionally, other potential conflicts can arise when one law firm represents multiple clients.\\r\\nFor example, a disagreement could arise in the future as to the respective duties, responsibilities or\\r\\nculpability of the parties. The firm mighthe given conflicting instructions from you regarding strategy,\\r\\nhow to handle the defense, or whether to settle, and on what terms. We could not act as your attorneys\\r\\nin resolving any such disagreements or conflicting instructions. You would need to resolve such\\r\\ndisagreements among yourselves, without or without independent legal counsel, and provide us with a\\r\\ncommon set of instructions. In the event you could not agree and we continued to receive conflicting\\r\\ninstructions, we might be required to withdraw from the representation entirely and you would be\\r\\nrequired to each hire separate legal counsel. Alternatively, under the consent and waiver discussed\\r\\nbelow, we might withdraw from representing one of you and continue representing the other(s). As\\r\\ndiscussed above. in that circumstance, confidential information that we gained during our concurrent\\r\\nrepresentation of your interests might be used by our remaining client(s) in a manner adverse to your\\r\\ninterests.\\r\\nIn the event that a conflict of interest arises which prevents us from continuing to jointly\\r\\nrepresent you, withdrawal from the representation might be required. In that event, you might be\\r\\nrequired to hire new counsel and incur considerable additional expense. A withdrawal could also come\\r\\nat an inconvenient time, and delays harmful to your interests could be encountered as a result of your\\r\\nneed to hire new counsel.\\r\\nYou should consider these risks in deciding whether to consent to our joint representation. You\\r\\nshould also consider the potential benefits of concurrent representation, which include a significant\\r\\ndegree of economic efficiency, coordinated legal assistance and a unified case strategy, and efficient use\\r\\nof knowledge gained in the case.\\r\\nLikewise, because each of you has the right to discharge the firm and retain new legal counsel at\\r\\nany time and for any reason, or no reason at all. it is agreed that, if you did decide to discharge the firm\\r\\nand hire new counsel, then the firm could continue to represent the remaining client(s), that none of you\\r\\nwould object to the firm continuing to represent the remaining clients, and that none of you would seek\\r\\nto disqualify the firm from continuing to represent the remaining clients, even in matters that are\\r\\nsubstantially relatéd to work done for you in the past, or in this matter, and even if such representation\\r\\nwas adverse to your interests.\\r\\nif the firm withdrays from your representation, or if you elects to retain separate counsel, then\\r\\nyou agrees to accept a copy of the client file in full discharge of the firm's duty to deliver the client file,\\r\\nand agrees that the firm may retain the original client file.\\r\\nIf you are not completely comfortable at this time with any of the risks. consequences,\\r\\nagreements and procedures discussed above, then you should not agree to have the same law firm jointly\\r\\nrepresent your interess. Rather, you should retain separate and independent counsel. After you have\\r\\nconsidered the risks and consequences. as well as the benefits, of the law firm's concurrent\\r\\nrepresentation of your interests, and if you are comfortable with the arrangement described above, then\\r\\nyou should countersign this letter, signifying your receipt of this conflicts of interest disclosure and your\\r\\nagreement and consent to the firm's representation of potentially or actually conflicting interests.\\r\\nPlease take as much time as you need to decide whether to consent to the joint representation.\\r\\nYou are encouraged to consult with independent legal counsel regarding these disclosures and the\\r\\nconsequences of waiving potential or actual conflicts of interest as outlined above.\"\n        }}"
